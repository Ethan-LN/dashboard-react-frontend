# Stock Price Prediction Frontend

Welcome to the front-end repository of the Stock Price Prediction project! This React application serves as the user interface for the stock price prediction system. It provides an interactive and user-friendly platform for users to access stock price data and view predictions generated by machine learning models.

## 🚀 Features

- Retrieve stock price data from Yahoo Finance API.
- Display historical stock prices and predicted prices using interactive charts.
- Allow users to search and select specific stocks for analysis.
- Integrate with the backend API for data retrieval and predictions.
- Implement responsive design for optimal user experience on various devices.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for flexible and customizable styling.

## 📂 Project Structure

The structure of the frontend directory is as follows:

- `public/`: Contains the public assets and the root HTML file.
- `src/`: Contains the source code of the React application.
  - `components/`: Includes reusable components used throughout the application.
  - `pages/`: Defines the main pages/screens of the application.
  - `services/`: Contains the API service for communicating with the backend.
  - `utils/`: Includes utility functions and helpers.
  - `App.js`: The main component that sets up the application routes.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of the React application.

## ⚙️ Installation and Setup

To set up the frontend locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from the GitHub/Jira repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed.
3. Open a terminal and navigate to the `frontend/` directory.


## 🏗 Development Process

If you would like to contribute to the front-end development, follow these steps:

1. Use the GitHub/Jira repository for project management and issue tracking. Create and assign tasks to team members as needed.
2. Implement new features or make improvements to existing components based on the project requirements.
3. Ensure code quality by following best practices, including writing reusable components and adhering to the project's coding style guidelines.
4. Test your changes thoroughly to ensure functionality and compatibility across different devices and browsers.
5. Commit your changes and submit a pull request for code review.

## 🧪 Testing

Unit tests play a crucial role in maintaining code quality. Although the testing section is primarily focused on backend testing, you can also write tests for the front-end components. Follow these steps:

1. Write unit tests for each component using a testing framework like Jest or React Testing Library.

2. Verify that all tests pass and maintain sufficient code coverage.
